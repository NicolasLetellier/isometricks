# isometricks

isometricks is an easy isometric editor, for the browser.

It is currently under development, but feel already free to try it: https://isometricks.com.

This project is open to collaboration, and any comment is welcomed! Please open an issue for any bug, or to request/propose a feature. Please also open an issue to discuss any change before pushing a PR (unless it's a very obvious correction), but I would really appreciate any contribution. Thanks!

## under the hood

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
You can use the different scripts it provides for local development (`npm start`), test (`npm test`) and build (`npm build`).

The web app is hosted in Github pages, with the help of [gh-pages](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages).

The font used in the isometricks logo is [baloo](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/baloo), from fontsquirrel.

The icons used in the toolbar are made by [Freepik](https://www.flaticon.com/authors/freepik), [bqlqn](https://www.flaticon.com/authors/bqlqn) and [Those Icons](https://www.flaticon.com/authors/those-icons) from [www.flaticon.com](https://www.flaticon.com/), even if their SVGs are modified and/or embedded in code.
