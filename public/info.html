        <h2>
          What is it?
        </h2>
        <p>
          isometricks.com is meant to be an easy-to-use digital counterpart of isometric paper, with the features of an editor, to be used directly in the browser (use it on mobile, tablet or desktop, with any OS).
        </p>
        <h2>
          And what for?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Isometric projections are an easy way to represent 3D shapes on a 2D image. With this editor, you can draw shapes based on basic isometric tiles (or "faces"). It can be used for quick prototyping of isometric designs, such as logos for example. Or just have fun with it, experimenting and drawing isometric shapes, illustrations or illusions!
        </p>
        <h2>
          How to use it?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The easiest isometric shape is a cube, you draw it with three faces: a left face, an upper face, and a right face. Just select the face you want to draw in the editor's toolbar, and click on the grid where you want to draw it. That's it!
        </p>
        <p>
          Current features are (in the order they appear in the toolbar):
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            grid size selector
          </li>
          <li>
            download the current illustration as SVG file
          </li>
          <li>
            history backward and forward buttons
          </li>
          <li>
            face selector buttons
          </li>
          <li>
            configuration tool for faces' colors
          </li>
        </ul>
