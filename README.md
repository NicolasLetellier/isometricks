# isometricks

isometricks is an easy isometric editor, for the browser.

It is currently under development, but feel already free to try it: https://isometricks.com.
Any comment is welcomed! It will be soon open to collaboration too.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
You can use the different scripts it provides for local development (`npm start`), test (`npm test`) and build (`npm build`).
